== Purpose

GZIP is the standard compression format on Unix/Linux systems for single files. It uses the Deflate algorithm and is widely supported across all platforms.

|Archive Support
|Single file only (use with TAR for multiple files)

|Large Files
|Yes

|Best For
|Single file compression, web servers, Unix systems
|===

== Basic Usage

=== Compress a File

[source,ruby]
----
# Compress single file
Omnizip.compress_file('data.txt', 'data.txt.gz')

# With compression level
Omnizip.compress_file('data.txt', 'data.txt.gz',
  level: 9  # Maximum compression
)
----

=== Decompress a File

[source,ruby]
----
# Decompress GZIP file
Omnizip.decompress_file('data.txt.gz', 'data.txt')

# Decompress to automatically named file
Omnizip.decompress_file('data.txt.gz')  # Creates data.txt

== Streaming Compression

GZIP supports streaming for large files:

[source,ruby]
----
# Stream compress large file
File.open('large.bin', 'rb') do |input|
  Omnizip::Gzip::Writer.open('large.bin.gz') do |output|
    while chunk = input.read(65536)
      output.write(chunk)
    end
  end
end
