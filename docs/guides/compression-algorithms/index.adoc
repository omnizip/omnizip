== Compression Algorithms Overview

Omnizip supports 6 major compression algorithms, each optimized for different use cases. Choose the right algorithm based on your needs for compression ratio, speed, and compatibility.

== Choosing an Algorithm

=== By Priority

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Priority |Recommended Algorithm

|Maximum Compression
|LZMA2 (level 9) or LZMA (level 9)

|Best for Text
|PPMd (for text-heavy content)

|Speed Critical
|Zstandard (level 3) or Deflate (level 3)

|Compatibility
|Deflate (universally supported)

|Multi-core Systems
|LZMA2 (parallel processing)

|Balanced
|LZMA2 (level 5-6) or Zstandard (level 5)
|===

=== By File Type

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|File Type |Best Algorithm

|Source Code
|LZMA2 or PPMd

|Text Documents
|PPMd or BZip2

|Binary Executables
|LZMA2 with BCJ filter

|Images (uncompressed)
|Zstandard or LZMA2

|Already Compressed
|Deflate (fast) or store mode

|Mixed Content
|LZMA2 with solid archive
|===

== Compression Levels

Most algorithms support compression levels 1-9:

[cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
|Level |Speed |Ratio |Best For

|1-2
|Very Fast
|Basic
|Quick archiving, testing

|3-4
|Fast
|Good
|Development, temporary files

|5-6
|Medium
|Very Good
|**Default** - balanced performance

|7-8
|Slow
|Excellent
|Distribution, backups

|9
|Very Slow
|Best
|Archival, long-term storage
|===

== Format Support
