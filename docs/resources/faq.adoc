== Frequently Asked Questions

=== General Questions

==== What is Omnizip?

Omnizip is a pure Ruby compression library supporting multiple compression algorithms (LZMA, LZMA2, BZip2, PPMd, Deflate, Zstandard) and archive formats (7z, ZIP, RAR, TAR, etc.) with zero external dependencies.

==== Why use Omnizip?

* **Portability** - Works on all Ruby platforms (MRI, JRuby, TruffleRuby)
* **No Dependencies** - Zero external dependencies or native extensions
* **Comprehensive** - Support for 10+ archive formats and 6 compression algorithms
* **Extensible** - Registry-based plugin architecture

==== How fast is Omnizip?

Pure Ruby implementation is 10-60x slower than native implementations:

* LZMA encode: 13-15x slower
* LZMA decode: 8-10x slower
* BWT transform: 50-60x slower

This is an acceptable trade-off for maximum portability.

=== Installation

==== What Ruby version is required?

Ruby 3.0 or higher is required.

==== Does Omnizip work on JRuby?

Yes, Omnizip works on JRuby 9.4+.

==== Does Omnizip work on TruffleRuby?

Yes, Omnizip works on TruffleRuby 22+.

=== Usage

==== How do I compress a file?

[source,bash]
----
omnizip compress input.txt output.lzma
----

[source,ruby]
----
Omnizip.compress_file('input.txt', 'output.lzma')
----

==== How do I create an archive?

[source,bash]
----
omnizip archive create backup.7z documents/
----

[source,ruby]
----
writer = Omnizip::Formats::SevenZip::Writer.new('backup.7z')
writer.add_directory('documents/')
writer.close
----

==== How do I extract an archive?

[source,bash]
----
omnizip archive extract backup.7z output/
----

[source,ruby]
----
reader = Omnizip::Formats::SevenZip::Reader.new('backup.7z')
reader.extract_all('output/')
reader.close
----

==== What compression level should I use?

* **Levels 1-3**: Fast compression for temporary files
* **Levels 4-6**: Balanced speed/ratio for general use (default: 5)
* **Levels 7-9**: Maximum compression for storage

=== Compatibility

==== Can Omnizip extract 7-Zip archives?

Yes, Omnizip can extract archives created by 7-Zip.

==== Can Omnizip create ZIP files?

Yes, Omnizip can create ZIP files compatible with all ZIP tools.

==== Can Omnizip create RAR archives?

Yes, Omnizip can create RAR5 archives using pure Ruby implementation.

=== Performance

==== How can I speed up compression?

1. Use lower compression levels (--level 1-3)
2. Use faster algorithms (zstandard, deflate)
3. Enable parallel processing (--threads)
4. Use compression profiles for automatic selection

==== Why is compression slow?

Pure Ruby implementation prioritizes portability over performance. Native implementations are 10-60x faster but require platform-specific compilation.

=== Troubleshooting

==== Compression failed with "Algorithm not found"

Ensure the algorithm name is correct:

[source,bash]
----
omnizip list  # See available algorithms
----

==== Archive extraction failed

Verify the archive is not corrupted:

[source,bash]
----
omnizip archive list archive.7z
----

Try different extraction options or check file integrity.

==== Out of memory error

For large files, consider:

1. Using chunked processing
2. Reducing compression level
3. Using faster algorithms

=== Advanced

==== How do I use filters?

[source,bash]
----
omnizip archive create binaries.7z app.exe --filters bcj_x86
----

[source,ruby]
----
writer = Omnizip::Formats::SevenZip::Writer.new('binaries.7z',
  filters: [:bcj_x86]
)
----

==== How do I encrypt archives?

[source,bash]
----
omnizip archive create secure.7z data/ --password "PASSWORD"
----

[source,ruby]
----
writer = Omnizip::Formats::SevenZip::Writer.new('secure.7z',
  password: 'PASSWORD'
)
----
