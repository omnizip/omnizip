== Use Case Recommendations

=== Choose Omnizip When:

✅ You need a pure Ruby solution (no native extensions)
✅ You want 7-Zip format support in Ruby
✅ You're migrating from rubyzip and need better compression
✅ You need both ZIP and 7z formats in one library
✅ You want programmatic Ruby API with good documentation
✅ You need streaming and in-memory operations
✅ Cross-platform consistency is critical

=== Choose Rubyzip When:

✅ You only need ZIP format support
✅ You have existing rubyzip code to maintain
✅ Pure simplicity is more important than features
✅ ZIP compatibility is your only requirement

=== Choose 7-Zip When:

✅ Maximum compression ratio is required
✅ You're working with very large files
✅ Command-line interface is acceptable
✅ Native C++ performance is essential
✅ You need the broadest format support

=== Choose WinRAR When:

✅ You specifically need RAR format write support
✅ You're primarily on Windows platform
✅ You have a WinRAR license
✅ Recovery records are critical

== Migration Guides

=== From Rubyzip to Omnizip

Simplest migration - add one line:

[source,ruby]
----
# Add this at the top of your file
require 'omnizip/rubyzip_compat'

# All existing Zip::* code now uses Omnizip
Zip::File.open('archive.zip') do |zip|
  # Works exactly the same
end
----

See link:guides/migration-rubyzip.html[Complete Migration Guide]

=== From 7-Zip CLI to Omnizip API

Replace command-line calls with Ruby API:

[source,ruby]
----
# Instead of: system('7z a archive.7z files/')
Omnizip::Archive.create('archive.7z', format: :seven_zip) do |archive|
  archive.add_directory('files/')
end
----
