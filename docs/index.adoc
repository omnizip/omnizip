== Omnizip: Pure Ruby compression library

=== Purpose

Omnizip is a comprehensive pure Ruby implementation of compression algorithms and archive formats. Built on an extensible, registry-based architecture with clean object-oriented design, Omnizip provides full-featured compression capabilities without external dependencies.

This implementation supports multiple compression algorithms (LZMA, LZMA2, BZip2, PPMd7/8, Deflate, Deflate64, Zstandard), preprocessing filters (BCJ variants, Delta), encryption (AES-256), and complete support for multiple archive formats (.7z, ZIP, RAR, TAR, ISO, CPIO, GZIP, XZ, BZIP2).

It provides both a command-line interface and a programmatic Ruby API, making it ideal for applications requiring portable, dependency-free compression without relying on system-level libraries or external binaries.

**Pure Ruby Implementation:** Works on all Ruby platforms (MRI, JRuby, TruffleRuby) with zero external dependencies. Performance is 10-60x slower than native implementations, which is an acceptable trade-off for maximum portability.

=== Example Usage

.Compressing a file
[source,ruby]
----
require 'omnizip'

# Simple one-liner
Omnizip.compress_file('input.txt', 'output.zip')

# With options
Omnizip.compress_file('input.txt', 'output.lzma',
  algorithm: :lzma,
  level: 9
)
----

.Command-line interface
[source,bash]
----
# Compress a file
omnizip compress input.txt output.lzma --level 9
