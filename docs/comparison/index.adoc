== Comparison with Other Tools

This section provides detailed comparisons of Omnizip against other popular archive and compression tools.

== Overview

Omnizip is designed to be a pure Ruby compression library with advanced features. Understanding how it compares to other tools helps you make informed decisions about which tool to use for your needs.

== Key Differentiators

=== Pure Ruby Implementation

Unlike most compression tools, Omnizip is written entirely in Ruby with no C extensions or external dependencies. This provides:

* **Portability** - Runs anywhere Ruby runs
* **Maintainability** - Easy to understand and modify
* **Security** - No binary dependencies to audit
* **Debugging** - Full visibility into compression logic

=== Multiple Format Support

Omnizip supports multiple archive formats in a single library:

* ZIP (read/write)
* 7z (read/write)
* RAR (read-only)
* TAR (read/write)
* ISO (read-only)

=== Advanced Algorithms

Native implementation of advanced compression algorithms:

* LZMA/LZMA2
* BZip2
* PPMd7/PPMd8
* Deflate64
* Zstandard

=== Rubyzip Compatibility

Drop-in replacement for the rubyzip gem with enhanced features.

== Use Case Recommendations

=== Choose Omnizip When

* You need pure Ruby implementation
* You want 7-Zip format support in Ruby
* You need advanced compression algorithms (LZMA2, PPMd)
* You're migrating from rubyzip and want better compression
* You need both ZIP and 7z formats in one library
* You want good API design and documentation

=== Choose Rubyzip When

* You only need ZIP format support
* You want the most mature Ruby ZIP library
* You have existing rubyzip code to maintain
* Pure simplicity is more important than features

=== Choose 7-Zip When

* You need maximum compression ratio
* You're working with very large files
* Command-line interface is acceptable
* Native C++ performance is required

=== Choose WinRAR When

* You specifically need RAR format write support
* You're on Windows platform primarily
* You have a WinRAR license

== Performance Considerations

As a pure Ruby implementation, Omnizip trades some performance for portability:

* **10-60x slower** than native C implementations
* **Excellent** for Ruby-native environments
* **Acceptable** for moderate file sizes
* **Portable** across all platforms
