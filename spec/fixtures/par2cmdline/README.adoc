= PAR2 Test Fixtures

These test fixtures are derived from the par2cmdline reference implementation:
https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline

par2cmdline is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later.

== Purpose

These fixtures are used for testing compatibility with the PAR2 specification
as implemented by par2cmdline, which is the reference implementation for the
PAR2 file format.

== Attribution

The test data files in this directory were extracted from the par2cmdline
project's test suite and are used here to verify that Omnizip's PAR2
implementation correctly handles real-world PAR2 archives.

== License

The test fixtures themselves fall under the GPL v2.0 or later license, as
they are derivative works from par2cmdline.

However, Omnizip's implementation is an independent, clean-room implementation
based on publicly available PAR2 format specifications.

These test files are not distributed in the Omnizip gem releases, but are
included in the source repository for testing purposes only.

* `flatdata.tar.gz` - Simple flat file structure test case (1,984 bytes)
* `flatdata-par2files.tar.gz` - PAR2 parity files for flatdata (47,620 bytes)
